# Contributing to camp-css

## Development

### Getting Started

1. Create a fork of the `ActiveCampaign/camp-css` repository.
2. Create a new branch to do your work on.

### Available Tasks

- `yarn start` - Builds the css, and then watches for changes in the `scss` directory
- `yarn run build` - Builds the css both unminified, and minified
- `yarn run validate` - Runs the linting, and tests against the css/scss

### Pushing Changes

1. Make your fixes, edits, changes, updates, etc. Commit your changes and push to your branch.
2. When you're ready to merge, create a PR (pull request) to be reviewed

**Note:** If necessary, update any relevant documentation according to your changes. If your merge creates breaking changes, have a plan in place to ensure the necessary people are aware of your changes.
